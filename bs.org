#+TITLE: Bread Scheme
* Dataframe Format
Dataframes will be represented as CSV files, with a header row containing all
fields, followed by ordered data rows. This is how all dataframes will be
stored on disc or their serialized format between scripts.

#+BEGIN_SRC CSV
t,o,h,l,c,sma10,sma50,sma200, ....
1293948292,33.21,34.50,33.10,28.37,44.39,24.77,...
#+END_SRC

Within schemes, dataframes will be represented by their own record type. This
record type contains a /headers/ field and a /data/ field.

+ The /headers/ field is an alist of all header string names associated with
  their given index within each point.
+ The /data/ field is a list of vectors containing each point. Order between
  fields is preserved for all vectors and corresponds to the index specified
  in the /headers/ field.

** Dataframe Methods [4/5]
*** DONE Get Column
Gets a list representing an entire dataframe column.
*** DONE Get Row
Gets a particular row of a dataframe.
*** DONE Get Field
Extracts a particular field from a row based on the header name.
*** DONE Apply Function
Apply a function or list of functions to the dataframe and add their associated
columns.
*** TODO Clean
Clean out any rows with missing values from the dataframe.
* Basic Calculations [0/5]
** TODO Overnight Gap
Finds the overnight gap between the close and open of 2 points.
** TODO Percent Change
Finds the percent change between two numbers.
** TODO New High
Determines if the current point represents a new high for all previous points.
** TODO Absolute Distance
Determines the absolute distance between two numbers whether they are positive
or negative.
** TODO Frequency
Determines the frequency of occurance in all points of data.
* Indicators [0/5]
** TODO Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Calculates the simple moving average over a set of points.
** TODO Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Calculates the exponential moving average over a set of points.
** TODO Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Calculates the MACD over a set of points. Requires previous indicator
calculation.
** TODO Average True Range (ATR)
Calculates the average true range over a set of points.
** TODO Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
Calculates the relative strength indicator over a set of points.
* Derived Indicators (Proprietary) [0/4]
** TODO Volume Spike
Determines if the current point is a volume spike.
** TODO Pocket Pivot
Determines if the current point is a pocket pivot.
** TODO Gapup
Determines if the current point is a buyable gapup.
** TODO Maxima
Determines if the current point is a relative maxima or minima.
* Aggregate Indicators [0/3]
** TODO Pocket/Gapup Frequency
Calculates the frequency of both pocket pivots and gapups over the time window.
** TODO Market Direction
Determines if the current point is a new maxima or minima.
** TODO Score
Calculates the overall score of the current point.
